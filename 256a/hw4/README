256a HW4 - Webleep
 * What is it?
Webleep is a 2-player (currently) networked musical toy where players can collaborate to build and tweak a looping free-form sequence of tones.

 * Compile
1. cd into the oscpack directory and run "make" there
2. cd back to the hw4 directory and run "make there"
This will compile Webleep for OS X or linux. It will compile RtAudio to use Jack, and will work on the CCRMA machines or a mac as long as you are running a jack server.

 * Usage
./Webleep

You can now click to create points, which will flash and make a simple pitched sound when the moving playhead hits them. Create patterns and hear how they sound! You can also click and drag to move points, or right-click on points to delete them.

(optional) Tell a friend to run Webleep on another computer (on the same network, for now). Then, one of you should hit c and type in the IP address and port of the other player (which will be in the top left of their game window for easy discovery. This will connect you and now you can make a pattern together.

You'll need to be running Jack for Webleep to start up.

 * Minimal?
I kept trying to perfect small & frivolous/tangential features of this app, which is counter to the assignment, so I'm handing it in now. If I had more time to work on this, I'd make it more than 2-player, give it more interesting sound design than Attack/Released sine waves, work on performance, and create a server browser, along with plenty of other tweaks (like making it prettier!).
