Add -fPIC in intelligent way to build system for 64-bit builds
Add weighted temporal features as per Peeters (xtract_weighted_mean etc) weight given as argv?
Improve noise robustness of xtract_f0
Fix xtract_hps - it doesn't work!
Add Max/MSP external example
Check and add return values as appropriate. Make them more sensible!
...do other stuff and eventually...
...optimise!
Use the fftw guru interface to create multipurpose global plans from xtract_fft_init()
Add LPC via Schur algorithm
Write macro to truncate numbers <= 0 prior to taking log and integrate into functions across the library
Add functionality to Pd example to convert symbols 'XTRACT_MEAN', 'XTRACT_*' to corresponding integers to ease the construction of argv lists
