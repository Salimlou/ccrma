NOTE:
My second submission (this one) is just for 2 minor bugfixes. If it's late enough that it's going to use up a late day, don't use it! My previous submission works just fine, grade that.

Bugs fixed in the second submission:
 - using pixel centers for barycentric interpolation
 - clipping(scissoring) on the near and far z-planes
