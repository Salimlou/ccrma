% The attack in the compressed version starts at 1 sec and lasts until
% approximately 1.06 seconds (attack time constant set to 10ms). The
% release starts at 3 sec and lasts until approximately 3.6 seconds
% (release time constant set to 100ms). These match up with the attack and
% release times shown in the graph in the reader.
